"""Regression guard: the README must not promise a PyPI install that fails.

`agent-undo` is not published on PyPI (https://pypi.org/pypi/agent-undo/json returns
404), yet an earlier revision of this README led its Quick Start with

    pip install agent-undo

as the first command a reader was told to run. That command cannot work: pip
reports "Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement agent-undo (from
versions: none)". Every other README in this family had already been corrected
to install from Git, which meant the defect was invisible -- the class of bug
was not guarded anywhere, so it could return at any time.

This guard is network-free on purpose. A test that asked PyPI whether the name
resolves would pass in CI and fail at 3am when the index is unreachable, and it
would also pass the moment the name is claimed by a third party, which is a
different bug from the one being guarded here. Instead the contract asserted is
the one this repository controls: **every bare `pip install <name>` line must
name a distribution the README explicitly declares it does not have yet.** A
README that wants to stop carrying the "Not on PyPI yet" note has to delete the
note and the bare install line in the same commit, which is a reviewable change.

The `test_the_guard_detects_a_planted_offender` test at the bottom feeds this
module's own extractor a deliberately bad README. Without it, an extractor
broken into always returning an empty list would make every assertion below
trivially true -- a guard that cannot fail is worse than no guard at all.
